# Simple python program that can monitor selected wifi

Hi, this is one of my first program, looking for feedback :) 

In this project, I am using OOP in a way that I understand. Everyone knows examples of OOP with a "car object" or a 
"castomer object" that can do different things. So the Program class (src/app.py) can also do different things.

I noticed that it is actually quite convenient, we create an object and then in the while loop we work 
with the previously created object. 

So, the program is located in the app.py file In the other files there are supor classes (monitoring.py wifi.py). 
Is this how it is done ? I do not know the first time I use this
